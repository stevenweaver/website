# Does the Internet Dream?

In Werner Herzog’s new documentary, Lo And Behold: Reveries Of The Connected
World, Herzog asks the question “Does the Internet Dream?” to several engineers,
scientists, and thought-leaders. To me, the Internet is the means of
communication between machines, and does not include computations outside of the
protocols and algorithms that route information. After being able to accept a
new definition that includes all computers on the network, I started to wonder
why Herzog would even ask the question in the first place, and soon shared his
despair he surely felt by the responses he received afterwards. For example, an
engineer replying with “Yes, because they remember inputs received by sensors in
the past and can make future predictions based off of them”. 

It is not surprising that Herzog would be drawn towards the idea of an emotional
artificial intelligence. Herzog’s documentaries routinely revolve around the
apathy of nature, and that, ultimately, fighting against a chaotic and hostile
environment is the unfortunate essence of the human experience. The human
experience is also a lonely one, and Herzog struggles to discover shared
sentiment even with penguins in Antarctica. 

The greatest irony would be to willfully surround ourselves with a new
intelligence that cannot dream and cannot feel, yet make the critical decisions
for us. After all, the Grizzly Man is about a bear-lover who was eaten by his
furry friends, and I can’t help but feel that Herzog may feel that AI may result
in the same consequences.
