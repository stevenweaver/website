## Steven Weaver

I'm a Senior Programming Analyst in the Institute for Genomics and Evolutionary
Medicine at Temple University.

My primary interest is to build systems and applications that assist in both
accelerating research in bioinformatics and have direct practical application in
public health. This includes, but is not limited to, the use of tools,
languages, and frameworks like Node.js, React, C++, Python, and numerous
bioinformatics software as part of RNA-Seq pipelines, phylogenetic analysis, and
user-friendly web applications.

In addition, I am responsible for the configuration and maintenance of high
performance computing environments in datacenters at the San Diego
Supercomputing Center and Temple University.
